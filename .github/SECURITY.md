# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Use **GitHub Security Advisories** to report privately:
- Go to the repository → **Security** → **Advisories** → **New draft security advisory**.

We will respond in the advisory thread and coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline there.
