# Threat Model

This document is link-first and maps review threats to existing canonical docs and pack artifacts.

## assets

- Decision and safety evidence: `report/procurement_pack/buyer_pack/plan/closed_loop_latest.json`, `report/procurement_pack/buyer_pack/verify/k8s_verify_latest.json`, `report/procurement_pack/buyer_pack/dryrun/k8s_plan.json`.
- Procurement and policy docs: `report/procurement_pack/docs/SECURITY_POSTURE.md`, `report/procurement_pack/docs/SECURITY_QA.md`, `report/procurement_pack/docs/COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md`, `report/procurement_pack/docs/WORKFLOW.md`.
- Release and distribution controls: `report/procurement_pack/docs/RELEASE.md`, `report/procurement_pack/docs/DISTRIBUTION_POLICY.md`.
- Pack integrity material: `report/procurement_pack/checksums.sha256`, `report/procurement_pack/procurement_pack.tar.gz`.

## trust boundaries

- Local authoring and review workspace vs. generated artifacts under `report/procurement_pack/**`.
- Documentation claims vs. reproducible outputs generated by `./bin/mk-procurement-pack` and `./bin/mk-enterprise-eval`.
- Public non-mutating evaluation paths vs. gated mutation/apply paths described in `docs/WORKFLOW.md` and `docs/PLAYBOOKS.md`.

## threat categories

- Evidence tampering: pack artifacts or docs modified after generation.
- Claim/evidence drift: narrative docs diverge from generated buyer evidence.
- Gate bypass claims: reviewers cannot confirm required controls from artifacts.
- Supply-chain/release confusion: reviewers cannot tie release and distribution statements to canonical policy.

## mitigations

- Verify integrity before review with `sha256sum -c report/procurement_pack/checksums.sha256`; workflow and verification context: `docs/PROCUREMENT_PACK.md`, `docs/BUYER_PROOF_PACK.md`.
- Anchor safety and gate assertions to canonical behavior docs: `docs/WORKFLOW.md`, `docs/PLAYBOOKS.md`; confirm in artifacts: `report/procurement_pack/buyer_pack/verify/k8s_verify_latest.json`, `report/procurement_pack/buyer_pack/plan/closed_loop_latest.json`.
- Keep security posture and RFI answers link-first and reviewable in-pack: `docs/SECURITY_POSTURE.md`, `docs/SECURITY_QA.md`; packed copies: `report/procurement_pack/docs/SECURITY_POSTURE.md`, `report/procurement_pack/docs/SECURITY_QA.md`.
- Map control claims to a single matrix and packaged copy: `docs/COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md`, `report/procurement_pack/docs/COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md`.
- Tie procurement narrative to deterministic bundle generation and included docs: `docs/PROCUREMENT_PACK.md`, `report/procurement_pack/docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`, `report/procurement_pack/procurement_pack.tar.gz`.
- Bind release and distribution statements to canonical policy and packaged references: `docs/RELEASE.md`, `docs/DISTRIBUTION_POLICY.md`, `report/procurement_pack/docs/RELEASE.md`, `report/procurement_pack/docs/DISTRIBUTION_POLICY.md`.
