# Compliance Matrix

Link-first control mapping for enterprise Security/Procurement review.

| Control area | ModeKeeper mechanism | Evidence (docs + procurement artifact paths) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Change management | Deterministic release flow with wheel-only policy, denylist audit, and smoke-gated tagging in the canonical release script. | Docs: [`docs/RELEASE.md`](docs/RELEASE.md), [`docs/DISTRIBUTION_POLICY.md`](docs/DISTRIBUTION_POLICY.md), [`docs/WORKFLOW.md`](docs/WORKFLOW.md). Procurement artifacts: `report/procurement_pack/docs/RELEASE.md`, `report/procurement_pack/docs/DISTRIBUTION_POLICY.md`, `report/procurement_pack/docs/WORKFLOW.md`, `report/procurement_pack/meta/versions.txt`, `report/procurement_pack/meta/pip_freeze.txt`. |
| Least privilege | Read-only-by-default execution model with apply blocked unless verify, kill-switch, and license/entitlement gates pass. | Docs: [`docs/SECURITY_POSTURE.md`](docs/SECURITY_POSTURE.md), [`docs/WORKFLOW.md`](docs/WORKFLOW.md), [`docs/BUYER_PROOF_PACK.md`](docs/BUYER_PROOF_PACK.md). Procurement artifacts: `report/procurement_pack/docs/SECURITY_POSTURE.md`, `report/procurement_pack/docs/WORKFLOW.md`, `report/procurement_pack/buyer_pack/plan/closed_loop_latest.json`, `report/procurement_pack/buyer_pack/verify/k8s_verify_latest.json`. |
| Audit logging | Run artifacts and decision traces provide auditable evidence for plan/verify/export/dry-run flows. | Docs: [`docs/SECURITY_POSTURE.md`](docs/SECURITY_POSTURE.md), [`docs/BUYER_PROOF_PACK.md`](docs/BUYER_PROOF_PACK.md), [`docs/WORKFLOW.md`](docs/WORKFLOW.md). Procurement artifacts: `report/procurement_pack/buyer_pack/plan/closed_loop_latest.json`, `report/procurement_pack/buyer_pack/verify/k8s_verify_latest.json`, `report/procurement_pack/buyer_pack/dryrun/explain.jsonl`, `report/procurement_pack/buyer_pack/dryrun/summary.md`. |
| Software supply chain | Public distribution boundary, wheel-only release, and wheel-content guardrails/denylist checks. | Docs: [`docs/DISTRIBUTION_POLICY.md`](docs/DISTRIBUTION_POLICY.md), [`docs/RELEASE.md`](docs/RELEASE.md), [`docs/SECURITY_POSTURE.md`](docs/SECURITY_POSTURE.md). Procurement artifacts: `report/procurement_pack/docs/DISTRIBUTION_POLICY.md`, `report/procurement_pack/docs/RELEASE.md`, `report/procurement_pack/meta/pip_freeze.txt`, `report/procurement_pack/checksums.sha256`. |
| Data handling | No secret/key/license commit policy, local/runtime credential handling, and documented distribution boundary controls. | Docs: [`docs/SECURITY_POSTURE.md`](docs/SECURITY_POSTURE.md), [`docs/DISTRIBUTION_POLICY.md`](docs/DISTRIBUTION_POLICY.md), [`docs/SECURITY_QA.md`](docs/SECURITY_QA.md). Procurement artifacts: `report/procurement_pack/docs/SECURITY_POSTURE.md`, `report/procurement_pack/docs/DISTRIBUTION_POLICY.md`, `report/procurement_pack/docs/SECURITY_QA.md`. |
| Incident response | Incident/breach handling and operational response runbooks with release-blocking enforcement for boundary leaks. | Docs: [`docs/PLAYBOOKS.md`](docs/PLAYBOOKS.md), [`docs/DISTRIBUTION_POLICY.md`](docs/DISTRIBUTION_POLICY.md), [`docs/WORKFLOW.md`](docs/WORKFLOW.md). Procurement artifacts: `report/procurement_pack/docs/WORKFLOW.md`, `report/procurement_pack/docs/DISTRIBUTION_POLICY.md`, `report/procurement_pack/docs/SECURITY_POSTURE.md`. |
